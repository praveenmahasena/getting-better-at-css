# Frontend Mentor Challenges

This repository is dedicated to completing challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.com/).
Each challenge is done **on a separate branch** and focuses on solving real-world frontend problems.

✅ **Rules for this repo:**
- Each challenge is done in its **own branch**.
- **No LLM (Large Language Model) help** is used for **CSS** — everything is hand-coded.
- Open to learning, experimenting, and improving frontend skills.

---

## Why?

Frontend Mentor provides real, professional designs and challenges that help sharpen HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React skills.
This repo is my way to stay accountable, track progress, and build a better frontend intuition.

## How it's organized

- **`main` branch** → This README and general repo info.
- **`challenge-name` branches** → Each specific challenge (ex: `profile-card-component`, `nft-preview-card`).
